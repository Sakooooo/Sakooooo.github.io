	    <h1>Picking between Jellyfin or Plex</h1>
	    <p><em>Feburary 29, 2024</em></p>
	    <p>1 Week ago, I've been contempating on if using Plex was a better option than Jellyfin (The Better Option) but now I've had made up my mind with a choice I seriously do not like :P</p>
	    <h2>The said reasons</h2>
	    <p>TLDR; Better clients, server is somehow more stable, subtitles actually sync</p>
	    <p>One of the biggest reasons I'd want to begin with is the fact that Plexamp has been made free and is a godsend for selfhosting your music compared to something like Jellyfin</p>

	    <p>I mean, just look at this and tell me you'd still use subsonic for music streaming!</p>

	    <p>(This is of course taken on an iPhone and I have no knowledge of android clients that may be better than plexamp for jellyfin)</p>

	    <p>Its honestly the closest you'll ever get to modern winamp from what I think winamp looks like (I didn't have a computer during the times of winamp)</p>

	    <p>Now, I don't know if this is pure laziness or actual planning but the desktop app just so happens to look exactly like the mobile app!!</p>
	    <img style="width: 50vw;" src="./plexamp_desktop.png">
	    <p>It also just so happens to have different placements for different sizes (I found this on accident)</p>

	    <h2>Honestly, I think thats it???</h2>
	    <p>In the end, of course Jellyfin is the better solution, currently Plex would be the better solution for now but Jellyfin has started to catch up with Plex</p>
	    <p>Soooooo <b>USE JELLYFIN</b></p>
	    <p>And don't forget to disable the remote forwarding thing on Plex if you ever decide to use it! Some Lastpass employee got the entire company breached via it!</p>
