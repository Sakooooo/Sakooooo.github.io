# Web Development is horror!
How does ANYONE even manage to keep their sanity doing this???

I physically cannot make myself believe this is the same technology that powers around 90% of our mobile apps.

Setting the margin to -0.5 just so the navbar can stay at the top of the screen is absurd.

I hate this shit good job Meta.
